STATE :NOTHING BUT A JS OBJECT THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE IN FUTURE 
for rendering or for performing any operation 
react uses js object to implement state
 js object:key value pair
state should have same name 
changing the state manually does n't re render (NEVER DO  THIS)

INSTEAD USE SETSTATE FUNCTIOn
this.setState (pass value of new state)

old way to dec state :
constructor()
super()
this.state ={
hdhhsj
}

PROPS : DATA THAT WE CAN TRANSPORT /COMM FROM PARENT TO CHILD COMPONENT
CLASS COMP: this.props. name of prop
fun:pass down as an arg
